Settings in game.json
=====================

  ms_per_game_cycle

        Number of milliseconds for one game cycle.
        25 ms gives approx. 40 cycles per second (and 40 frames per second, since the screen
        is updated on every cycle).

        Decreasing this value will increase speed of the game (enemy movement, bullets speed, etc).

  map_hotkey_ctrl_i

        Enables Ctrl-i hotkey, which opens and closes sector inventory screen.

  tactical_hotkey_j

        Enables 'j' hotkey for climbing up/down.

  tactical_hotkey_shift_n

        Enables 'Shift-n' hotkey which switches the current squad's head gear to the night mode.

  tactical_hotkey_ctrl_n

        Enables 'Ctrl-n' hotkey which switches the current squad's head gear to the day mode.
