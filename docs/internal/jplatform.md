# JPlatform

Abstraction layer over SDL2 at the moment.

Goals:
- separate the game code from the platform code
- make the platform code replaceable, so there is two implementations:
  SDL2 and Win32 api with DirectDraw (as in ja2-vanilla)

## Why J

That prefix is not used currently for anything else.
